Maven Doxia

 Doxia is a content generation framework which aims to provide its users with powerful
 techniques for generating static and dynamic content: Doxia can be used in web-based
 publishing context to generate static sites, in addition to being incorporated into
 dynamic content generation systems like blogs, wikis and content management systems.

 Doxia supports {{{./references/index.html}markup languages with simple syntaxes}}. Lightweight markup languages
 are used by people who might be expected to read the document source as well as the rendered
 output.

 Doxia is used extensively by {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven}} and it powers the entire
 documentation system of Maven.
 It gives Maven the ability to take any document that Doxia supports and output it any format.

 The current version of {{{./doxia/}Doxia base framework}} is ${doxiaVersion}.

* Brief History

~~ {{{http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html}Aptconvert}}

 Based on the (now defunct) Aptconvert project developed by
 {{{http://www.xmlmind.com/}Xmlmind}}, Doxia was initially hosted by
 {{{http://codehaus.org/}Codehaus}}, to become a sub-project of Maven early in 2006.
