Using the Doxia Sink API

%{toc|section=1|fromDepth=2|toDepth=2}

* {Transforming documents}

  Doxia can be used to transform an arbitrary input document to any supported output format.
  The following snippet shows how to use a Doxia <Parser> to transform an apt file to html:

+----
  File userDir = new File( System.getProperty ( "user.dir" ) );
  File inputFile = new File( userDir, "test.apt" );
  File outputFile = new File( userDir, "test.html" );

  SinkFactory sinkFactory = (SinkFactory) lookup( SinkFactory.ROLE, "html" ); // Plexus lookup

  Sink sink = sinkFactory.createSink( outputFile.getParentFile(), outputFile.getName() ) );

  Parser parser = (AptParser) lookup( Parser.ROLE, "apt" ); // Plexus lookup

  Reader reader = ReaderFactory.newReader( inputFile, "UTF-8" );

  parser.parse( reader, sink );
+----

  It is recommended that you use {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org/}Plexus}} to look up the parser. In principle
  you could instantiate the parser directly ( <<<Parser parser = new AptParser();>>> )
  but then some special features like macros will not be available.

  You could also use the {{{http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia-tools/doxia-converter/index.html}Doxia Converter Tool}}
  to parse a given file/dir to another file/dir.


* {Generating documents}

  The snippet below gives a simple example of how
  to generate a document using the Doxia Sink API.

+----
    /**
     * Generate a simple document and emit it
     * into the specified sink. The sink is flushed but not closed.
     *
     * @param sink The sink to receive the events.
     */
    public static void generate( Sink sink )
    {
        sink.head();

        sink.title();
        sink.text( "Title" );
        sink.title_();

        sink.author();
        sink.text( "Author" );
        sink.author_();

        sink.date();
        sink.text( "Date" );
        sink.date_();

        sink.head_();


        sink.body();

        sink.paragraph();
        sink.text( "A paragraph of text." );
        sink.paragraph_();

        sink.section1();
        sink.sectionTitle1();
        sink.text( "Section title" );
        sink.sectionTitle1_();

        sink.paragraph();
        sink.text( "Paragraph in section." );
        sink.paragraph_();

        sink.section1_();

        sink.body_();

        sink.flush();
    }
+----

  A more complete example that also shows the 'canonical' order of events to use when generating
  a document, can be found in the Doxia
  {{{./doxia/doxia-core/xref-test/org/apache/maven/doxia/sink/SinkTestDocument.html}SinkTestDocument}}
  class.


* {Passing attributes to Sink events}

  A number of methods in the Sink API enable passing
  a set of attributes to many sink events. A typical use case is:

+----
SinkEventAttributeSet atts = new SinkEventAttributeSet();
atts.addAttribute( SinkEventAttributes.ALIGN, "center" );

sink.paragraph( atts );
+----

  The kind of attributes supported depends on the event and the sink
  implementation. The sink API specifies a list of suggested attribute
  names that sinks are expected to recognize and parsers are expected to use
  when emitting events.


* {Avoid sink.rawText!}

  In <<Doxia 1.0>> it was a common practice to use sink.rawText() to generate elements that
  were not supported by the Sink API. For example, the following snippet could be used
  to generate a styled HTML \<div\> block:

+----
sink.RawText( "<div style=\"cool\">" );
sink.text( "A text with a cool style." );
sink.rawText( "</div>" );
+----

  This has a major drawback however: it only works if the receiving Sink is a HTML Sink.
  In other words, the above method will not work for target documents in any other format than HTML
  (think of the FO Sink to generate a pdf, or a LaTeX sink,...).

  In <<Doxia 1.1>> a new method unknown() was added to the Sink API that can be used to emit
  an arbitrary event without making special assumptions about the receiving Sink.
  Depending on the parameters, a Sink may decide whether or not to process the event,
  emit it as raw text, as a comment, log it, etc.

  The correct way to generate the above \<div\> block is now:

+----
SinkEventAttributeSet atts = new SinkEventAttributeSet();
atts.addAttribute( SinkEventAttributes.STYLE, "cool" );

sink.unknown( "div", new Object[]{new Integer( HtmlMarkup.TAG_TYPE_START )}, atts );
sink.text( "A text with a cool style." );
sink.unknown( "div", new Object[]{new Integer( HtmlMarkup.TAG_TYPE_END )}, null );
+----

  Read the javadocs of the unknown() method in the
  {{{./doxia/doxia-sink-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/doxia/sink/Sink.html}Sink}} interface and the
  {{{./doxia/doxia-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/doxia/sink/XhtmlBaseSink.html}XhtmlbaseSink}}
  for information on the method parameters.
  Note that an arbitrary sink may be expected to ignore the unknown event completely!

  <<In general, the rawText method should be avoided alltogether when emitting events into an arbitrary Sink.>>


* {How to inject javascript code into HTML}

  Related to the above, here is the correct way of injecting a javascript snippet into a Sink:

+----
// the javascript code is emitted within a commented CDATA section
// so we have to start with a newline and comment the CDATA closing in the end
// note that the sink will replace the newline by the system EOL
String javascriptCode = "\n function javascriptFunction() {...} \n //";

SinkEventAttributeSet atts = new SinkEventAttributeSet();
atts.addAttribute( SinkEventAttributes.TYPE, "text/javascript" );

sink.unknown( "script", new Object[]{new Integer( HtmlMarkup.TAG_TYPE_START )}, atts );
sink.unknown( "cdata", new Object[]{new Integer( HtmlMarkup.CDATA_TYPE ), javascriptCode }, null );
sink.unknown( "script", new Object[]{new Integer( HtmlMarkup.TAG_TYPE_END )}, null );
+----
