Introduction

 Doxia allows you to write books like user manuals and guides in any format supported by Doxia. You can include the manuals directly in your generated site with links to the off-line
 friendly formats like XDoc, PDF, RTF and LaTeX.

 The Xdoc output which has been rendered into this site can be viewed {{{../doxia-example-book/index.html}here}}.

 The generated PDF is {{{../doxia-example-book/doxia-example-book.pdf}here}} and the generated RTF
 {{{../doxia-example-book/doxia-example-book.rtf}here}}.

* How It Works

 The only thing you need in addition to the content files is a simple book descriptor which specifies
 the ordering of the sections and the names for the chapters.

* Creating a Book Descriptor

 An XML file describes the layout of the book.

 A sample is given below:

%{snippet|id=example|file=content/books/example-book.xml}

* Configuring Doxia Book Maven Plugin

 This example illustrates how to configure the Doxia Book Maven Plugin. It will render the book in three different formats.
 By default the output will be under <<<target/generated-site/<format>/<book id> >>>.

 The currently supported format ids are: <<<xdoc>>>, <<<pdf>>>, <<<latex>>>, <<<rtf>>>, <<<xhtml>>>, <<<doc-book>>>

 A sample <<<pom.xml>>> is given below:

%{snippet|id=configuration|file=pom.xml}
