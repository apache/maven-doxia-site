# Maven Doxia

Doxia is a content generation framework which aims to provide its users with powerful techniques for generating static and dynamic content: Doxia can be used in web\-based publishing context to generate static sites, in addition to being incorporated into dynamic content generation systems like blogs, wikis and content management systems\.

Doxia supports [markup languages with simple syntaxes](./references/index.html)\. Lightweight markup languages are used by people who might be expected to read the document source as well as the rendered output\.

Doxia is used extensively by [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) and it powers the entire documentation system of Maven\. It gives Maven the ability to take any document that Doxia supports and output it any format\.

The current version of [Doxia base framework](./doxia/) is ${doxiaVersion}.
