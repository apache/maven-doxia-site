# Enhancements to the APT format

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In the following we provide a list of differences/enhancements to the original [APT](./apt-format.html) format that were incorporated in Doxia\. Apart from some exceptions, these differences are usually &apos;backwards\-compatible&apos;\. That is, any document that gets correctly processed by Aptconvert should also be a valid Doxia input file and lead to identical results when processed by a Doxia parser\.

<!-- MACRO{toc|section=1|fromDepth=2|toDepth=2} -->
## <a id="Paragraphs_in_list_items"></a>Paragraphs in list items

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Contrary to the original APT parser, the Doxia APT parser does not put list items within paragraphs\. Eg, the example given in the APT guide:

```unknown
    * List item 1.
```

will, for instance, produce the following html:

```unknown
    <li>List item 1.</li>
```

To get the same result as aptconvert, use

```unknown
    *

      List item 1.
```

which will produce:

```unknown
    <li><p>List item 1.</p></li>
```

## <a id="Table_header_cells"></a>Table header cells

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Header cells are defined by an additional pipe character &apos;|&apos; at the beginning of the cell:

```unknown
*-----------+-----------+
|| Header 1 || Header 2 |
*-----------+-----------+
| Cell 1    | Cell 2    |
*-----------+-----------+
```

produces:

|Header 1|Header 2|
|:---|:---|
|Cell 1|Cell 2|
## <a id="Multi-lines_cells_in_table"></a>Multi\-lines cells in table

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Since 1\.1, multi\-lines cells are recognized with the character &apos;\\&apos; at the end of the cells:

```unknown
*-----------+-----------+
|| Header 1 || Header 2 |
*-----------+-----------+
| Cell\     | Cell 2    |
| 1         |           |
*-----------+-----------+
```

produces:

|Header 1|Header 2|
|:---|:---|
|Cellï¿½  
1|Cell 2|
## <a id="Anchors"></a>Anchors

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
### <a id="Anchors_for_section_titles"></a>Anchors for section titles

Contrary to the original APT format, section titles are **not** implicitly defined anchors\. If you want an anchor for a section title you need to define it explicitly as such:

```unknown
* {Anchors for section titles}
```

### <a id="Anchor_construction"></a>Anchor construction

Contrary to the original APT format, an anchor/link is **not** its text with all non alphanumeric characters stripped\. Ideally, an anchor should be a valid Doxia id, ie it must begin with a letter \(\[A\-Za\-z\]\) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits \(\[0\-9\]\), hyphens \(&quot;\-&quot;\), underscores \(&quot;\_&quot;\), colons \(&quot;:&quot;\), and periods \(&quot;\.&quot;\)\. Any anchor that does not satisfy this pattern is transformed according to the following rules:

- Any whitespace at the start and end is removed
- If the first character is not a letter, prepend the letter &apos;a&apos;
- Any spaces are replaced with an underscore &apos;\_&apos;
- Any characters not matching the above pattern are stripped\.

Note in particular that case is preserved in this conversation and that APT anchors and links are case\-sensitive\. So the anchor for the section title in the previous example would be `Anchors_for_section_titles`\.

## <a id="Links"></a>Links

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

In **Doxia\-1\.1** the notion of a &apos;_local_&apos; link was introduced in addition to _internal_ links and _external_ links\.

- An **internal** link is a link to an anchor within the same source document\.

    In the APT format used by **Doxia\-1\.1**, internal links have to be valid Doxia ids, as specified in the anchors section above\.

    Note in particular that internal links in APT do **not** start with &apos;\#&apos;\.

- A **local** link is a link to another document within the same site\.

    In the APT format used by **Doxia\-1\.1**, local links **have to** start with either `./` or `../` to distinguish them from internal links\. E\.g\.,

    ```
      {{{doc/standalone.html}Standalone}}
    ```

    is not valid, it should be

    ```
      {{{./doc/standalone.html}Standalone}}
    ```

    Note in particular that the following link

    ```
      {{{standalone.html}Standalone}}
    ```

    will be interpreted as an internal link \(dots are valid characters in anchor names\)\. Since you most likely meant to link to another source document, you should again prepend a &quot;\./&quot;\.

- An **external** link is a link that is neither local nor internal\.

    An external link should be a valid [URI](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)\.

Anchors are always translated to a valid id, including escaping\. In some situation this can cause issues, especially when referring to a javadoc\-link\.  
Since Doxia 1\.4 there is support for literal anchors, by using 2 hashed \(\#\#\) instead of 1\. This implies that the writer is responsible for using the right URL encoding\!

```

## <a id="Figure_extensions"></a>Figure extensions

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Contrary to the original APT format, a figure name has to be given fully **with** extension\. For instance:

```unknown
[/home/joe/docs/mylogo.jpeg] Figure caption
```
