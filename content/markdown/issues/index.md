# Doxia Issues &amp; Gotchas

This document collects some infos about specific issues and &apos;gotchas&apos; when working with Doxia\. Please check also the [Frequently Asked Questions](../faq.html)\.

<!-- MACRO{toc|section=1|fromDepth=2|toDepth=2} -->
## <a id="Apt_anchors_and_links"></a>Apt anchors and links

Using **Doxia 1\.1** you may see a lot of warnings when processing old Apt source files:

```unknown
[WARNING] [Apt Parser] Ambiguous link: 'doxia-apt.html'. If this is a local link, prepend "./"!
```

and

```unknown
[WARNING] [Apt Parser] Modified invalid link: references/doxia-apt.html
```

The reason is that in Apt, links to other source documents have to start with either `./` or `../` to distinguish them from internal links\. Please read the sections on [anchors](../references/doxia-apt.html#Anchors) and [links](../references/doxia-apt.html#Links) in our Apt guide\. Note in particular that internal links in Apt do **not** start with &apos;\#&apos;\.

**You should pay attention to these warnings since your links will most likely be broken\.** Unfortunately, the warning message cannot indicate the source file with the broken link \(see eg [MPDF\-11](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MPDF-11)\), however, if you run in `DEBUG` mode, eg invoke maven with the `-X` switch, you can see which source document is being parsed when the warning is emitted\.

## <a id="Figure_sink_events"></a>Figure sink events

Doxia distinguishes between figures, which are block\-level elements, and images \(or icons\), which are in\-line elements\. For instance, the following sequence of sink events

```unknown
sink.figure( null );

sink.figureGraphics( "figure.png", null );

sink.figureCaption( null );
sink.text( "Figure caption", null );
sink.figureCaption_();

sink.figure_();
```

should output the equivalent of this html snippet:

```unknown
<div class="figure">
  <p><img src="figure.png"/></p>
  <p>Figure caption</p>
</div>
```

while the `figureGraphics( ... );` event alone can be used to generate an in\-line image, i\.e\. just the `<img>` tag in case of html\.

**Note** that we are using the forms that take a `SinkEventAttributeSet` above, even though we are just passing in null values\. The reason is that the alternative forms \(without `SinkEventAttributeSet`\) have a different behavior, which is kept for backward compatibility \(but the methods have been deprecated\)\. Using the same sequence of sink events as above, but omitting the `null` method parameters, will generate

```unknown
<img src="figure.png" alt="Figure caption"/>
```

## <a id="Empty_Generated_Page"></a>Empty Generated Page

After running `mvn site` using your Maven reporting plugin, you see that the generated page is empty\. Be sure that the the code calls `sink.close()`\.
